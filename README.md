# The Tree of Life

Here at Trike Apps, we've been tasked with a very important assignment.

Dr Reginald T Cranshaw, of Splexford University, worked closely with us to develop a method of cataloguing all the wonderous variations of life forms on planet Earth. Dr Cranshaw wasn't a technologist, and so insisted on storing all the data from his research in a convoluted folder structure that represented the [Tree of Life](http://tolweb.org/tree/).

## What we did
Trike Apps assisted by building a Ruby class that could peruse the files he created and enable him to find species he'd already catalogued. Each file he created is named with the latin name of the species, and contains the common name of the species along with what it eats and how it moves. This is very important for Dr Cranshaw as he keeps live specimens of every species he researches, so he uses this tool to work out how to feed and exercise all of his critters.

## Then calamity struck...
Unfortunately, Dr Cranshaw allowed one of his lab assistants to use his computer one day, and the lab assistant managed to save a whole bunch of files into Dr Cranshaw's meticulously kept directory structures, and these new files have caused the code to fail in weird and unexpected ways. The directory structures are too enormous to go and remove the files manually, so we have to find another way.

## Help us out
No one has touched this class for a long time, and it's a bit of a mess. We need to:

* fix the problems with the class so Dr Cranshaw can feed and exercise his specimens
* refactor the class so that the next person to come along is able to make sense of what it does
* add comments that describe any design patterns that were used in the changes

Please help!
